# Symphony-Classic

Nothing is possible without our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. But everything is possible with Him. I was morally dying, addicted to ponrography and video-games. But He intervened, and gave me new life.

This repository was created to support the 2024 paper.
It is unification and simplification of Symphony-1.0, Symphony-2.0(2.1) and draft of Symphony-3.0 into single Symphony-Classic-UTD-5 version (Model-free Deterministic Algorithm)

I believe that industrial applications need not only a fast growth but an assymptotically stability in the learning process.
Some ideas were dropped and some proven their worth were solidified:

1. Temporal (Immediate) Advantage
2. Fading Replay Buffer
3. Rectified Learnable Sine Wave Activation Function
4. Rectified Huber Symmetric and Asymmetric Loss Functions
5. Seamless Actor-Critic update
6. Inplace Dropouts

Some modules were transferred from Pytorch nn.Module to Pytorch jit.ScriptModule.

PS: Nothing is possible without our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
